# Infant-Mortality-Rate-Project-Analysis
![Alt text](IMR_CodeYou_CP.png)
This project aims to analyze infant mortality rates in the world while focusing on under-five mortality rate. According to UNICEF, the under-five mortality rate refers to the probability a newborn would die before reaching exactly 5 years of age, expressed per 1,000 live births". The year 2022, concluded with the death of 4.9 million children under 5 years of age. This means that 13,400 children under the age of 5 died every day in 2022.
Factors including socio-economic factors, ... will be analysed.
Trends based on continents?


Python will be used for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling, SQL for database management, and Tableau for data visualization.

RESOURCES

FEATURES:
Data collection: Two .CSV data files were read
Data processing: The data was cleaned and a data merge performed with the two .csv files
                    Basic quality checks were then performed. eg: missing values and duplicates were checked for
                    Unnecessary cells/information was deleted

Visualizatiion: Tableau was used to create a dashboard to display the project analysis findings


Resources Required:
Birth cohort files with linked births and deaths data
Python development environment with necessary libraries installed
Tableau software for visualization
SQL database management system


Deliverables:
Cleaned and preprocessed birth cohort data
SQL database containing the linked births and deaths data
Python scripts for data analysis and modeling
Tableau dashboards and visualizations
Project report


Best Practices:
Clone the repository
Open Git
Create a virtual environment using Venv
Install venv to your host Python by running this command in your terminal:
 pip install virtualenv
To use venv in your project, in your terminal, create a new project folder, cd to the project folder in your terminal, and run the following command:
 python<version> -m venv venv #The second "venv" is the <virtual-environment-name>
 ~ pip install -r requirements.txt
 
How to Deactivate a Virtual Environment
To deactivate your virtual environment, simply run the following code in the terminal:
 ~ deactivate

To run this project, Git, Visual Studio Code, or Google Colab will be required
