Best Practices:
Clone the repository
Open Git
Create a virtual environment using Venv
Install venv to your host Python by running this command in your terminal:
 pip install virtualenv
To use venv in your project, in your terminal, create a new project folder, cd to the project folder in your terminal, and run the following command:
 python<version> -m venv venv #The second "venv" is the <virtual-environment-name>
 ~ pip install -r requirements.txt
 
How to Deactivate a Virtual Environment
To deactivate your virtual environment, simply run the following code in the terminal:
 ~ deactivate

To run this project, Git, Visual Studio Code, or Google Colab will be required
