Definition of IndicatorsUnder-five mortality rate: The probability of death occurring between birth and exactly 5 years of age, expressed as the number of deaths per 1,000 live births.Annual rate of reduction in under-five mortality rate: The annual percentage reduction in the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) defined as ARR=100*(ln(U5MRt2/U5MRt1)/(t1-t2)), where t1=2000 and t2=2021Infant mortality rate: The probability of death happening between birth and exactly 1 year of age, expressed per 1,000 live births.Neonatal mortality rate:	The probability of death occurring during the initial 28 days of life, expressed per 1,000 live births.Mortality rate (children aged 5 to 14 years):	The probability of dying at age 5–14 years expressed per 1,000 children aged 5.Probability of dying among children aged 5–14: The likelihood of death at ages 5–14 years, expressed per 1,000 children aged 5.Probability of dying among youth aged 15–24: The likelihood of death at ages 15–24 years, expressed per 1,000 youth aged 15.Probability of dying among adolescents aged 10–19: The likelihood of death at ages 15–24 years, expressed per 1,000 youth aged 15.Under-five deaths: The number of deaths among children under 5 years of age.Neonatal deaths: The number of deaths occurring within the first 28 days of life.Neonatal deaths as a percentage of under-five deaths: The percentage of under-five deaths occurring within the first 28 days of life.Deaths among children aged 5–14 years: The number of deaths among children aged 5 to 14 years.Stillbirth rate (SBR): The number of babies born with no sign of life at 28 weeks or more of gestation per 1,000 total births.Stillbirths: The number of stillbirths.Annual rate of reduction in stillbirth rate: The annual percentage reduction in the stillbirth rate (SBR) defined as ARR=100*(ln(SBRt2/SBRt1)/(t1-t2)), where t1=2000 and t2=2021
